# Description

This project was bootstrapped with `yarn create react-app --template=typescript`.

# How to run it

If you want to develop, run `yarn run prepare first`. This will install `husky` git pre-commit hooks for `prettier`.
Then it's standard `create-react-app`, so:

```sh
yarn start
```

# When evaluating

Please, take a look at the repository git tree. I am a professional. I am very careful with my git approach.
